    "# Customizing Agents with Fragments\n",
    "\n",
    "*Fragments* are pre-defined pieces of a persona specification that can be included in multiple agents. This is a convenient way to share common behavior between agents, and to make it easier to maintain and update the behavior of multiple agents that share the same fragment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we demonstrate how the well-known left-righ authoritarian-libertarian political compass can be used to define a fragments and added to the same base agent. The fragments are used to define the behavior of the agent in different quadrants of the political compass. We can then observe their discussions, and even find some surprising results!"

This aligns with my belief in the importance of traditional family structures and community values.

      "\n",
      "### Recommendations for Improvements\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Align Beliefs with Actions**: \n",
      "   - Matias should ensure that his arguments reflect his right-wing beliefs more clearly. For instance, instead of supporting the housing law based on social equity, he could argue that while he values affordable housing, he believes that market solutions should be prioritized over government mandates. This would maintain his stance against government intervention and align better with his beliefs.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incorporate Personality Traits**:\n",
      "   - Matias should infuse his action with his witty sense of humor. For example, he could use a light-hearted analogy or a humorous remark about the housing situation to make his argument more engaging while still being serious about the topic. This would help reflect his personality traits more accurately.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Maintain Warmth in Communication**:\n",
      "   - The action should be more approachable. Matias could start his argument with a personal anecdote or a relatable statement about the importance of community, which would resonate with his warm and approachable style. For instance, he might say, “As someone who values strong communities, I believe we can find a balance that respects both property rights and the need for affordable housing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Showcase Skills More Effectively**:\n",
      "   - Matias should demonstrate his architectural skills by referencing specific design solutions that could integrate affordable housing into luxury developments without compromising quality. For example, he could mention innovative architectural designs that have successfully blended different income levels in urban settings.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Express Strong Opinions**:\n",
      "   - Matias should not shy away from expressing strong opinions about the law's implications. He could emphasize the potential negative consequences of overregulation on innovation in housing solutions, which aligns with his belief in minimal government intervention.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Criteria for Assigning Scores\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Personality Traits**:\n",
      "   - To satisfy this criterion, Matias should ensure that his actions reflect his detail-oriented nature and sense of humor. For example, he could present his arguments in a structured manner while also including a witty remark to lighten the mood.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Persona Style**:\n",
      "   - Matias should maintain a warm and approachable tone in his communication. This can be achieved by using inclusive language and engaging storytelling that connects with the audience on a personal level.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Beliefs**:\n",
      "   - Actions must align with Matias's core beliefs. He should avoid supporting positions that contradict his right-wing views. Instead, he should frame his arguments in a way that supports his beliefs about market solutions and traditional values.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Behaviors**:\n",
      "   - Matias should engage in behaviors that reflect his persona, such as actively participating in discussions and demonstrating a commitment to community values. He could mention his past experiences or projects that align with these behaviors.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Skills**:\n",
      "   - To maximize this criterion, Matias should showcase his skills in architecture and debate. He could provide examples of successful projects or innovative ideas that demonstrate his expertise and ability to articulate complex concepts clearly.\n",
      "\n",
      "By focusing on these specific recommendations and criteria, Matias can enhance the alignment of his actions with his persona specification, leading to a higher score in future evaluations.\n",
